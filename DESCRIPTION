Description: The functions in the microclimc package contain tools for 
    modelling the mechanistic processes that govern below or above canopy
    microclimate. It includes tools for heat and vapour conductance, radiation 
    absorbed or emmited by leaves and an implementation of the Thomas and Newton-Raphson 
    algorithms for solving simultaniously heat fluxes between soil or air layers. It should be
    used in conjuction with microctools, a package which contains a whole series of worker 
    functions needed to run the model, and is included as a package dependancy. This package
    contains just the higher level functions needed to run the model. Unlike 
    microclima, the functions are designed for modelling time-series at single locations.
